Most important is amount of hidden layers:
    best results for 2,3 hidden layers
    2 is slightly better when it comes to accuracy
    3 is better when it comes to mae
Less important is first layer
    256 gives the best result
    can be due too much more nets with 256 as first hidden layer
    64 also gives quite good results

Best shape for net is 3 hidden layers with 256 as first layer
